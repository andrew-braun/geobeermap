title: Craft Beer in Georgia
---
There's a reason you're here, on this website. Wine. As we all know, Georgia is one of the world's very first winemakers, and, of course, there's nothing else we'd ever even think of drinking. That's it! We can go home now--see you later, wine lovers!

Okay, I think they're gone--all you beer people can come out now. Oh, you're allowed to like wine too, of course, but we don't want to frighten the wine-drinkers with our easily-differentiable styles and creative freedom ;)

As you've probably figured out by now, Georgia has craft beer--and it's pretty damn good! IPAs, sours, stouts--they're all here, and the scene is growing fast. When I got here, though, finding out who was brewing the beers and where you could buy them was pretty difficult. It required a lot of random hunting around on old blogs and social media and a lot of visits to random locations that may or may not have actually served craft beer. 

That's why I started this site--it's a catalog of craft beer in Georgia (That's the "geo" in geobeermap, though "geo" could eventually mean "earth", of course), designed to show you who makes it and where to get it. The main feature is, of course the map, where you can search for and find the location of various breweries, but there's also a blog section where I'll post news and updates, and new features are going to be added over time. 

This site is a relatively simple start to what I hope will become a project with a lot more interesting things happening on it. If you'd like to contribute, either in terms of writing, telling me about new breweries/bars, or code, get in touch with me and/or check out the site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrew-braun/geobeermap). It's a static Gatsby site running with Netlify CMS and using MDX for posts and page content. I initially built it as a sort of learning project, so I'm super open to suggestions!

Now, go find yourself some beer!
