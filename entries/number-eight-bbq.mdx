Number 8 BBQ House is located in the very classy Ghvinis Karkhana (Wine Factory) complex, and is probably Tbilisi's premiere outdoor craft beer experience! You'll find all of Number 8's standard beers on tap here--IPA, stout, APA, wheat, etc.--as well as a selection of grilled meats, as the name implies. 

It also happens to be some of the only craft beer you'll find in the Wine Factory area, as most of the surrounding restaurants are (predictably) wine-heavy--though there are some classy cocktail bars nearby as well. Seating is a bit limited, and best-suited for pleasant weather (as it is all outdoors), but it's a must stop for any beer enthusiast thats finds themselves in wine country!
