	"body": "Made up of an enterprising group of international brewers, [Megobrebi](https://mgbrew.com) is one of the first and largest craft breweries in Georgia.\n\nThey operate a brewery near Tbilisi (you can tour it if you contact them and ask!) as well as a bar called Tsota Tsota, located in Sololaki. They have a solid range of flagship beers ranging from high-quality craft staples like IPAs and golden ales to more unusual flavors, like their cucumber kolsch and blackberry gose. They frequently brew experimental beers, particularly sours, which are still fairly new to the Georgian beer scene (as is most craft beer!). They also export quite a bit: you can find their beer in places as far away as Sweden and Taiwan.\n\nIf you're looking to try a Megobrebi beer in Georgia, your best bet is to go to a bar, as you're unlikely to find it in stores. Their own Tsota Tsota pub is, of course, a great place to start, and places like Sma, 9 Mta, Dive Bar, LOKAL Tbilisi, Kitchen Home Studio, and plenty of others have Megobrebi on draft or in bottles. They also may deliver bulk orders if you're located in the city.",
