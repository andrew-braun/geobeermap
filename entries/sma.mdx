Sma (სმა), which means "drink" in Georgian, is one of Tbilisi's original craft beer bars and a popular favorite among fans of craft beer in Georgia. It's located on Lado Asatiani street in Tbilisi's Sololaki district--the most craft-dense area of the city--so if you're in the area visiting Naturale, Black Dog, Tsota Tsota, or 9 Mta, Sma is right up the road! 

Sma serves up beer from a variety of local Georgian breweries as well as a selection of imported brews. They've typically got Underground Microbrewery and one or two others on tap, and sell bottles from quite a few others, including SeaHorse and Sunset Inn. They also have a rotating selection of imports, which often veer towards the unique and intriguing.

While the main interior is small, they've got an overflow section in the basement--great if you're there with a larger group and need some space. They also serve up some excellent food, including some of Tbilisi's best burgers!
