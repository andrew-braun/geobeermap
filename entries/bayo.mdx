Bayo's beer lineup is fairly standard, with their primary beers being an IPA, Hefeweizen, Blonde, and Imperial Stout. They are one of the few Georgian breweries to experiment with Belgian ales, however, and their Foxxy is a good example of the style. 

Their beer is a little harder to find than some of the other breweries, but most craft beer bars tend to carry at least their IPA.
