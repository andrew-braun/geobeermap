Bayo's beer lineup leans heavily towards IPAs, though that's far from their only trick. They also produce a Hefeweizen, an APA, an Imperial Stout, and in a relatively bold move for a Georgian brewery, a Belgian.  

Finding a Bayo beer is a little harder than with some of the other breweries, as they''re still getting started, but most craft beer bars tend to carry at least one of their IPAs. They will also make home deliveries throughout Tbilisi on request.
