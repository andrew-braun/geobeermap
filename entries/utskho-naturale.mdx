NaturAle is one of Tbilisi's staple breweries, and their bar in Orbeliani is a great place to find their drinks! The craft beer and chacha served up here are delicious and deadly, respectively, and guarantee you a good time.

NaturAle brews a few different IPAs, as well as a nice oatmeal stout, blonde, APA, and a few other styles. They come out with experiments every now and then, generally with good results (the mango IPA, for example). 

The bar's indoor space is small, but they are equipped with the takeaway plastic bottles that are common around Tbilisi, and will gladly pour a liter or two and seal it up for you (not sure if they still do this at the Orbeliani location; they did at at the Lado Asatiani one before it closed). They also bottle their beers, and you can find them distributed around Georgia. Like most local craft beers, you probably won't see them in chain retailers, but you stand a decent chance at a craft beer speciality bar or shop. They've also got a takeaway draft house in Saburtalo--Naturale Nutsubidze--which, as far as I know, is only available via Glovo.
