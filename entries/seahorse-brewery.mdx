SeaHorse Brewery is one of the older craft brewers in Tbilisi, and they're still cranking out reliably good beers! While they formerly operated Crafted Bar in Marjanishvili, they've shut it down and now exclusively distribute to other bars.

Their beer range tends to fall towards the standards: IPA, APA, stout, porter, wheat, lager, et cetera. You won't find the gonzo flavors often offered up by the other breweries, but there's still a lot to like about a solid SeaHorse beer!

If you want to get your hands on a SeaHorse in Georgia, you'll have to hunt one down at a bar. You can find them scattered around Tbilisi's craft beer bars and also in a few Batumi locations, like Sami Ludi.
