  Run by Megobrebi Brewery, Tsota Tsota (ცოტა ცოტა, meaning "a little bit, a
  little bit") Pub is Tbilisi's premier destination for... you guessed it,
  Megobrebi beers! What their compact (and stylish!) interior lacks in seating
  it makes up for in beer--and lots of it. They have an impressive tap selection
  and a fridge full of bottles, some of which you might not be able to find
  elsewhere. 


  You'll find all the Megobrebi favorites here, from stouts to lagers to ales, alongside some *very* impressive fruit liquors that taste dangerously less alcoholic than their potent 35% ABV. 


  Even better, Tsota Tsota is located in Sololaki, a stone's throw from Sma, Black Dog, and Naturale, making it a very easy stop on a craft beer bar hop. Their food menu complements their beer selection very well, and the whole experience is absolutely a cornerstone of the craft beer scene in Tbilisi!
