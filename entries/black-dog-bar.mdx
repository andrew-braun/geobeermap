Black Dog Bar serves up a variety of Number Eight-brewed beers in Tbilisi's Sololaki district, just a stone's throw from Liberty Square. The interior is small, but the food and beer are both enjoyable and the vibe is nice! It's sort of like the dive bar cousin to the more upscale Number Eight locations. 

The beers on tap are pretty much all from Number Eight, so if you like those beers, Black Dog Bar will be a hit! They tend to have all the classics, from the IPAs to the stouts, and are worth a look if you're in the neighborhood.
