Sami Ludi (სამი ლუდი) means "Three Beers" in Georgian, but this downtown Batumi craft beer bar generally has a few more than that! It's located in a "golden triangle" of Georgian alcohol, with the excellent Garage Wines across the street and Chacha Time next door. Sami Ludi is fairly small on the inside, but they've got a good selection of craft beers from around Georgia, friendly bar staff, and outdoor seating. They don't even mind if you get your beer to go and hang out across the street with your misguided wine-drinking friends. 

The beer selection at Sami Ludi changes often, but that's a good thing, as the craft beer scene in Batumi is *tiny* and this gives you a chance to try more variety. Most of the major craft breweries in Georgia are represented there, so you'll probably find beers from Megobrebi, Underground, Naturale, Bayo, Seahorse, Lost Ridge Inn, and others. 

Drink in, take out, or get delivery--if you're in Batumi, this is one of your craft beer lifelines!
