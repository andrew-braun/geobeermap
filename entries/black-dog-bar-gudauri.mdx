Black Dog Bar's Gudauri branch is the perfect spot to grab a craft beer after a day on the slopes. It's also the *only* spot, but hey, it's still pretty good! Much like the Tbilisi version, Black Dog Bar Gudauri is small, cozy, and pours Number Eight's craft beers along with a selection of food and mixed drinks. 

It's tucked away at the bottom of a building in New Gudauri, a bit away from the other bars and restaurants, but the Google Maps location and decent signage should help you find the place no problem.
