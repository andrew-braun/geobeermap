NaturAle brews a few different IPAs, as well as a nice oatmeal stout, blonde, APA, and a few other styles. They come out with experiments every now and then, generally with good results (the mango IPA, for example). 

They sell their beers out of a bar near Orbeliani Square, via Glovo, and at various bars and restaurants around Tbilisi.
